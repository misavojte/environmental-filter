In repository you can find simple function from my thesis called Modelling distribution of European grassland species (https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/mhx2b/), which was used to reduce sampling bias of entry records of species occurences. This easy function improved the performance of MaxEnt species distribution models (SDMs). 
You can use it freely, just attribute the source:)
